HFC is a bottom-up forward chainer and semantic repository implemented in Java
which have been developed over the last years and which is comparable to popular
systems such as Jena and OWLIM.
HFC supports RDFS and OWL reasoning a la Hayes (2004) and ter Horst (2005), but
at the same time provides a powerful language for defining custom rules,
involving functional and relational variables, complex tests and actions, and
the replacement of triples in favor of tuples of arbitrary length.
