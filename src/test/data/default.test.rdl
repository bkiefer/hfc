#
# this simulates OWLIM's owl-horst_partialRDFS_builtin.pie rule file that builds
# on the rule semantics for OWL as published by ter Horst which is based on Hayes'
# work for axiomatizing RDF Schema;
# I have split up rule $owl_FunctProp into $owl_FunctPropObject and
# $owl_FunctPropDatatype, since the nature of the object of the triple either
# leads to a owl:sameAs statement or to the bottom type owl:Nothing;
#
# NOTE: this file should only be used with HFC when the Boolean flag
#       equivalenceClassReduction in class TupleStore is turned on (default = off);
#       this file thus does NOT contain the rules copying over information
#       from subject, predicate, and object position as originally specified by
#         o $owl_sameAsCopySubj
#         o $owl_equivalentPropertyCopyPred
#         o $owl_sameAsCopyObj
